A project to demonstrate the basics of using Angular 2


# Instructions

## Download the repository

Go to http://bit.ly/hacksuangular and download the zip file or clone the repository
open the folder up and unzip if necessary

## Start the server

cd into the directory where you download the repository usually `cd ~/Download/Angular2-Example`
start the server by typing `npm start`, if you have an error type `npm install` and try it again

It should open a tab in your browser where you should see `Hello World`,
if either of those things don't happen ask and we'll work it out.
